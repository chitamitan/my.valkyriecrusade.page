                <p><b>ちたみたんnoob's Corner:</b></p>
                <p>So from the perspective of a noob player like me, one word can only define this event...</p>
                <p>It's SO bad. Times 10 raised to the nth power -___-</p>
                <p>The ever great Mynet has set Valkyrie Crusade's fate to go downhill ever since the release of the new card.</p>
                <p>Okay, maybe that sounded really exaggerating...</p>

                <figure style="border: 1px solid #808080; width: 256px; height: 390px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px;">
                    <img src="images/events/RelenasChallenge/Wise_Oracle.png" style="width: 100%; padding: 5px;"/>
                    <div style="padding: 0px 5px 5px 5px;">
                        <figcaption style="font-size: 12px"><em>The new LR card - Wise Oracle for the mega whales :v</em></figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>

                <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 70%;">

                <p>The new card features a brand new rarity - the LR Card. It probably stands for <b><em>Legendary Rare</em></b> or 
                something like that. Nobody knows at the moment.</p> 

                <p>The first of this kind, the ever so glorious Wise Oracle, was released on November 17, 2016.</p>

                <p>Wise Oracle's stats at Lvl 1 are almost twice the stats of a max leveled Legendary Archwitch card. In Awakened form.</p>

                <p>Cards so OP, even your LAW GURs would cry.</p>

                <p>However, to get everyone's pretty bae you would have to bet a <b>huge</b> amount of your savings, because the Summon where she is available doesn't guarantee her drop. Those who have successfully summoned her have spent Jewels not less than ~15k :D
                
                <p>Sad right? Don't worry, everyone is sharing the same sentiments.</p>

                <p>However, this event introduces another LR card for the players: <b>True Wolf Fenrir</b> She can be obtained by players who get a rank of 1 down to 100.</p>

                <p>A new item is also introduced in this event: the <b>LR Chance Ticket</b>. It can be obtained by getting into the Ranks 101 to 2000 and can be used with the "LR Chance Summon" that will open at December 1.</p>

                </div>

                <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 70%; margin-top: 10px;">

                <p>Having Fenrir's LR form and the LR Chance Tickets in the rewards, it won't be surprising if the rankings would enter into blood bath mode (or maybe money bath mode haha)</p>

                <p>With that said, let me rant out the problems I have found in this event.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>1.</b> Every pro or casher would probably try to reach at least Rank 2000. Many regular players are most likely to fall behind, thus they don't have the chance to get even one LR.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>2.</b> The Elemental Hall is the only area accessible for this event. They lied when they said you can train to your heart's content... Brittle Keys are still needed to enter. And because it IS the only area accessible, where on Celestial Realm are you going to get your stash of Keys? There can only be one answer... Ka-ching!</p>

                <p>Well actually, VC gave 10 Brittle Keys when the event started, and they also give a Brittle Key as a login bonus during certain hours, but of course not everyone can be online all the time :/</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>3.</b> AW subjugation points are nerfed <em>once again</em>. It seems like the Advanced level of battles in the Elemental Hall give large amount of points, but come on, not everyone can beat the Archwitches in those levels!</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>4.</b> No real event map, no free jewels. ):</p>

                <p>Right now people might be thinking about how whiny I am. I'll take that! xD But the whales obviously have the upper hand, especially since they most likely have the helper cards which make life during the events much much easier. Still, though, we should appreciate their efforts (or lack of effort, perhaps?) because their expenses are the ones keeping Valkyrie Crusade up and running. Thanks a lot, peeps! c(:</p>

                </div>

                <figure style="border: 1px solid #808080; width: 256px; height: 390px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <img src="images/events/RelenasChallenge/True_Wolf_Fenrir.png" style="width: 100%; padding: 5px;"/>
                    <div style="padding: 0px 5px 5px 5px;">
                        <figcaption style="font-size: 12px"><em>Final Ranking 1-100 reward: <br>[LR] True Wolf Fenrir</em></figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>

                <p>Also it's not like everything about this event is bad! There's also some stuff that would at least give the regular players something to smile on.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>1.</b> Reissued [UR] Regea. She can be obtained by amalgamating [HSR] Nona and [HSR] Morta, both of which are available as Panel Rewards. [UR] Regea may also appear as a Panel Reward!</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>2.</b> Fixed number of Chimry Coins depending on the difficulty of the battle. If you win a Beginner's level, you get 1 Chimry Coin, for Intermediate you get 2, for Advanced you get 4. I'm not really sure if it's a good thing, but at least you get Chimry Coins, I guess? Some don't get the Coins at all after battling at any difficulty during normal Elemental Hall sessions.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>3.</b> Slimes, Slimes, and LOTS of Slimes! And Slime Queen, too! I have tons of them hanging around in my Inbox, but it's better to have them around than having none of them. Since new cards come every now and then so materials for levelling up are very necessary.</p>

                <p>Also, Pylon-vasion and Loli madness -_-|| Just okay 'cause she works well as a feeder for Slimes :></p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>4.</b> [SR] 2nd Hammer, a card to be used in the second Abyssal Archwitch event. Lots of it can be obtained as Panel Reward :D</p>

                <p>Despite having so much reasons to skip this event, I'm just playing through it for the sake of wasting my Battle Points and Vitality. I've also decided to make as much Regea cards as I can :D</p>

                <p>That's all for this post! I'm really sorry for the long rant ^^||</p>

                <p>Have fun and more power, Celestial Lord!</p>
